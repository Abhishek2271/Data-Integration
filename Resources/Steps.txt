1. Tried to install entitymatching but there was an error saying "could not find a version that satisfies the requirement in python"
2. We then upgraded the pip with
	pip install --upgrade pip
3. This did fix the version error but we got new error:"fatal error lnk1112 module machine type 'x86' conflicts with target"
4. We tried different setting with Linker but it did not work
5. we uninstalled python and every dependency
6. Installed Python x86 then pip and then py_entitymatching with:
	install py_entitymatching
7. This time it worked but still we had to install/ upgrade the following dependencies to work:
	a. Upgrade "ipython":
		pip install --upgrade IPython
	b. Install "requests":
		pip install requests
	c. Install "sciphy"
		pip install sciphy
